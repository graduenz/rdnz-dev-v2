# Whoof

Whoof is a simple software project of an application to control pet vaccination, created with the **main purpose of learning how REST APIs can be implemented in different programming languages and frameworks to enrich my technical repertoire**, but also:

* Get hands-on practice with popular tools used in software engineering.
* Make it publicly available somehow. It's currently on AWS EC2 with CapRover (BE, .NET version) and Vercel (FE).
* Learn more about implementing a modern front-end application.
  * Possibly a mobile application too, someday.
* Demonstrate and share knowledge with the community.

## Important

ðŸ”¥ The ASP.NET Core version is the one that is publicly available, and it's likely to be the most complete one, being used as the source application to practice with some tools like Auth0, GitHub Actions, Grafana, and more; please take a look at [the repo docs](https://github.com/graduenz/whoof-aspnetcore/).

- Official API docs are public at https://whoof-docs.rdnz.dev/.
- Live demo (FE) at https://whoof.rdnz.dev/.
