# Hello!

### I am Guilherme Raduenz; people call me Gui (ɡɪ / gee).

I've been coding for 10+ years &horbar; more specifically since 2011, using mostly the .NET stack, and sometimes I [write about coding](/blog).

Born in [Pomerode](https://www.storyproductions.com/the-most-german-towns-in-brazil) and living in Blumenau (Brazil), I speak Portuguese natively, English every day at work, and a little bit of German ([heritage language](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/heritage-language)).

I have some [side projects](/labs), and I'll be sharing soon what I'm [currently working on](/now).

### What else?

#### There are some things I like:

- Petting, running, and playing with my dogs ([they have an Instagram!](https://instagram.com/ravena.dolar)).
- Driving on highways, traveling by car, even more in the countryside.
- Camping, hiking, and developing some survival skills &horbar; get in touch with nature.
- Cars, airplanes, and engineering &horbar; events, museums, etc.
- Something very simple: grilling steak and hanging out with friends.
- Cool weather &horbar; fall is the best season.
- Creating utilities, improving and automating things &horbar; on my routine, my house, etc.

#### And some things I want to do:

- Buy a house (finally home!) and stop paying rent.
- Become a father! :D
- Get a big 4x4 car to do some offroad trips with my whole family and dogs together.
- A long roadtrip by car in South America.
- Learn to speak more languages: German, Spanish, maybe another one.
- Ski or snowboard in the Austrian or Swiss alps.
- Go on a [WRC](https://www.wrc.com/) event in person &horbar; Finland on summer is "the dream".
