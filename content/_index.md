# Hello!

### I am Guilherme Raduenz; people call me Gui (ɡɪ / gee).

I've been coding for 10+ years &horbar; more specifically since 2011, using mostly the .NET stack, and sometimes I [write about coding](/blog).

Born in [Pomerode](https://www.storyproductions.com/the-most-german-towns-in-brazil) and living in Blumenau (Brazil), I speak Portuguese natively, English every day at work, and a little bit of German ([heritage language](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/heritage-language)).

I have some [side projects](/labs) which I work on from time to time, and I'll be sharing soon what I'm [currently working on](/now).

#### I know I like these things:

- Driving on highways, traveling by car, even more in the countryside.
- Camping, hiking, and doing things outdoor &horbar; get in touch with nature.
- Cars, airplanes, and engineering &horbar; go on events, visit museums, etc.
- Petting, running, and playing with [my dogs](https://instagram.com/ravena.dolar).
- Creating utilities, improving and automating things &horbar; on my routine, my house, etc.

#### And, I also want to...

- Become a father! :D
- Get a big 4x4 car to do some offroad trips with my whole family and dogs together.
- A long roadtrip by car in South America.
- Learn to speak more languages: German, Spanish, maybe another one.
- Ski or snowboard in the Austrian or Swiss alps.
- Go on a [WRC](https://www.wrc.com/) event in person &horbar; Finland on summer is "the dream".
