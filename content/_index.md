# Hello!

### I am Guilherme Raduenz; people call me Gui (ɡɪ / gee).

I've been coding for 10+ years &horbar; more specifically since 2011, using mostly the .NET stack, and sometimes I [write about coding](/blog).

Born in [Pomerode](https://www.storyproductions.com/the-most-german-towns-in-brazil) and living in Blumenau (Brazil), I speak Portuguese natively, English everyday at work, and a little bit of German ([heritage language](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/heritage-language)).

I have some [non-business side projects](/labs), and I'll be sharing soon what I'm [currently working on](/now).

### What else?

#### Things I like:

- Petting, running, and playing with [my dogs](https://instagram.com/ravena.dolar) &horbar; definitely #1 on this list;
- Cold weather &horbar; fall is the best season;
- Driving on highways, even more in the countryside;
- Cars and airplanes &horbar; events, museums, etc;
- Grilling steak, talking and hanging out with friends;
- Casually video gaming &horbar; RPGs and farming/flight/racing simulators;
- Creating utilities and automating things.

#### Things I want to do:

- Ski, then drink Jägermeister in the Austrian alps;
- Go on a [WRC](https://www.wrc.com/) event in-person &horbar; Finland would be the dream;
- Learn to fly an airplane as a private pilot;
- Stop renting and build or buy a house.
