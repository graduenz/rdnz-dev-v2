**Why does this repo exist?**
> I was using GitBook for my personal website, and I wanted to move away from it. My initial goal was to focus on content writing instead of coding a website from scratch, but things have changed.

## Problems

There is no way to properly setup a GitBook space at the domain root, rdnz.dev, and I had to create it under a subdomain; I chose gui.rdnz.dev for this. Then, I had to do some workaround in Cloudflare to make it work under the domain root, though it never worked exactly as I wanted.

It's time to get things right. I want to keep using GitBook for other projects, but not for the root domain.

## Proposal

Make use of the already-created markdown content and use some great framework that already works with markdown, then use GitHub Pages to publish it.
- Hugo looks good after some research, and also has some good templates to begin with.
- Both Hugo and GitHub Pages are free to use.
- Will change from documentation style website to pages + blog style.
